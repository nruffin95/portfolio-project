In This project I created A portfolio page to show my current and future work as a developer.
Links are attached to this page to add more visibility for items that are not included on the page
such as my linkedin profile, email address as well as projects that i am working on. Anchor tags were
also added so that the page has quick navigation from the top navbar. Made possible by css grid and flex
the page also allows for resizing of content to view on diffrent versions of mobile devices. The Project mock
up is as follows.
